# lexer

Lexers for different languages in Dart with Regular Expressions adapted from
 the awesome [pygments](http://pygments.org) library.

## Fork info

Requires Dart 3.x.x

In this fork, I migrated the original package to null-safety and added local `RegExpFlags` overrides for separate Parses.

To the best knowledge, this package works in the same way as the original one.
